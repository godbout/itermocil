# Why

1. [Apple got rid of the Python2 interpreter in 12.3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes)
2. The original iTermocil then breaks, and [hasn't been updated in a while](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil)
3. There's [another fork](https://github.com/PythonicNinja/itermocil) but it only creates panes, not windows

So here's an update of iTermocil running with Python3.

# Documentation

Please see the [original one](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil).

# Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Then install with `python3 setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin`

I have zero knowledge in Python. But it works.
